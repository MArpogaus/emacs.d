;; We're going to increase the gc-cons-threshold to a very high number to decrease the load time and add a hook to measure Emacs startup time.

;; PGTK builds only: this timeout adds latency to frame operations, like
;; `make-frame-invisible', which are frequently called without a guard because
;; it's inexpensive in non-PGTK builds. Lowering the timeout from the default

;; `company-box', and `posframe') feel much snappier. See emacs-lsp/lsp-ui#613.
