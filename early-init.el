;;; Code:

;; Configure Byte Compile

;; If an `.el' file is newer than its corresponding `.elc', load the `.el'.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

;; Disable certain byte compiler warnings to cut down on the noise.
(setq byte-compile-warnings '(not free-vars unresolved noruntime lexical make-local))

;; Optimize Startup Time
;; We're going to increase the gc-cons-threshold to a very high number to decrease the load time and add a hook to measure Emacs startup time.

;; The following optimisatzion have been inspired by:

;; - https://github.com/nilcons/emacs-use-package-fast#a-trick-less-gc-during-startup
;; - https://github.com/mnewt/dotemacs/blob/master/early-init.el
;; - https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/blob/main/docs/.emacs.d.example/early-init.el
