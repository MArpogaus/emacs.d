;; - https://github.com/nilcons/emacs-use-package-fast#a-trick-less-gc-during-startup


;; We're going to increase the gc-cons-threshold to a very high number to decrease the load time and add a hook to measure Emacs startup time.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum

;; Let's lower our GC thresholds back down to a sane level.

;; the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.

;; to skip the mtime checks on every *.elc file.

;; The following optimizations have been taken from [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/da3d0687c5008edbbe5575ac1077798553549a6a/lisp/doom-start.el#L30][here]].

(setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right

;; PERF: Disabling BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect
;;   reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses (and other
;;   bracket characters whose 'paired-bracket' Unicode property is non-nil).

;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases memory
;; usage, however!

;; PGTK builds only: this timeout adds latency to frame operations, like
;; `make-frame-invisible', which are frequently called without a guard because
;; it's inexpensive in non-PGTK builds. Lowering the timeout from the default

;; `company-box', and `posframe') feel much snappier. See emacs-lsp/lsp-ui#613.
